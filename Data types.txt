Data types
Depending on what data you need to store there are several kind of built-in data types. These are ofthen called fundemantal
data types or primitives.
char 1 byte integer or character
short 2 bytes
int 4 bytes integer
long 4 bytes
float 4 bytes
double 8 bytes Floating-point number
long double 8 bytes
bool 1 byte Boolean value

In C++, the exact size and range of the data types are not fixed. Instead they are dependent on the system for which the 
program is compiled. A byte in C++ is the minimum addressable unit of memory, which is garanteed to be at least 8 bits, but
might also be 16 or 32 bits depending on the system, By definition, a char in c++ is 1 byte in size. Furthermore, the int type
will have the same size as the processors's word size, so for a 32-bit system the integer will be 32 bits in size. 
Each integer type in the table must also be at least as large as the one proceding it. The same applies to floating-point
types where each one must provide at least as musch precision as the preceding one.
