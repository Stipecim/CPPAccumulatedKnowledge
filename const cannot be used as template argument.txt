A "const" variable cannot be used as a template argument because its value is not guaranteed to be known at compile-time

When a template is initialised, the compiler generates a new version of the template for each set of template arguments.
These new versions of the tamplate are created during compilation, so the values of the tempalte arguments must be known 
at compile-time.

thats why we use constexpr
