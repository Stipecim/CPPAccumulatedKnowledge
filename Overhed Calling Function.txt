Overhead from Calling a function depends on compiler settings and the way it optimises code. Some functions are inlined.
Others are not, It usually depends on wheter you'are optimiszing for size or speed.

Generally, calling function cause delay for two reasons:

- The program needs to hook to some random location in memory where your function code starts. To do this it needs to save the
  current cursor position into a stack so it know where to return. This process consumes more than one CPU cycle.

- Depending on your CPU architecture, there may be a pipleline, which fetches the next few instruction from memory into CPU
  chace in parallel with your current instruction execution. This is to speed up execution speed. When you call a function
  the cursor hooks to a completely different address and all the chached instructions are flushed from the pipline. This
  causes further delays
