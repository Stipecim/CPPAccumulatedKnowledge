Variables in C++ may be declared both globally and locally. A global Variable is declared outside of any code block
and will be accessible from anywhere after it has been declared, even in other source file in the same project.
Difference between local wariable and gloabl is that global variable will remain allocated for duration of the program, while
local variable will be destroyed when its function has finished executing.

DEFAULT VALUES
Global variables in C++ are automatically initialized to zero. Local variables however do not have this adventage,
Instead, they will contain whatever garbage is left in that memory location. It is therefore a good idea to always give your
local variables an initial value when they are decalared.
