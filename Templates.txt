templates are a mechanism in C++ that allows you to write code tat can work with any data type. A template is a blueprint 
of a function or a class that contains placeholders called template parameters. WHen a template is instantiated, the 
compiler generates a new version of the template for each set of template arguments by replacing the template parameters with 
actual data types and this process is called template instantiation. This way the same code can be used for multiple data 
types and the specialized version of code is generated for each data type used.
