Lvalue and rvalues are fundemental to c++ exepressions. Put simply, an lvalue is an object reference and an rvalue is a vlaue.
the fifference between lvalues and rvalues play a role in the writing and understanding of expressions.

An lvalue is an expression that yields an object reference, such as a variable name, an arrry subscript reference, a 
dereferenced pointer, or a function call that returns reference. An lvalue always has a defiend region of storage, so you can 
take its adress.

An rvalue is an expression that is not an lvalue. Examples of rvalues include literals, the results of most operator, and 
function calls that return noreferencess. An rvalue does not neccessariliy have any storage associated with.

A function is an Lvalue, but he only uses for it are use it in calling the function, or determining the functions adress.
Most of hte time the term lvalue means object lvalue.
