class type(Student) of object ( s1("Jhon", 10) )
class type(Student) of object (s2 = s1) 

When s2 is being constructed, the default copy contructor for Student will be supplied by the C++ compiler whenever there's
a missing user-defined copy constructor. The default copy constructor will copy each attribute of the class as is(this 
is refered as shallow copy). Which means, both s1.name and s2.name point to the same C-string.
