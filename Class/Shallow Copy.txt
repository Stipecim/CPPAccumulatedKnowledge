In shallow copy, an object is created by simply copying the data of all variables of the original object. That works well
if non of the variables of the object are defined in the heap section of memory.If some variables are dynamically allocated
memory from heap section, then the copied object variable will also reference the same memory location.

This will create ambiguity and run-time errors, dangling ponter. Since both objects will reference to the same memory
location, then change made by one will reflect those change in another object aswell. Since we wanted to create a replica
of the object, this purpose will not be filled by Shallow Copy.
