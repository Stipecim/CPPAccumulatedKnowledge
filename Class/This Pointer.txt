Each object gets its own copy of the data member.
All-access the same function definition as present in the code segment.

Meaning each object gets its own copy of data members and all objects share a single copy of member functions.
Only one copy of member function exists and is used by multiple objects, this is how proper data members are accessed and
updated. The compiler supplies an implicit pointer along with the names of the function as "this". "this" pointer is
passed as a hidden argument to all non-static member functions calls ( all non-static member functions
can only access static variables in class and class object it doesn't need to be initialised. Can be called with 
class name::static_function() ) and is available as a local variable withinn the body of all non-static functions.
For class X, the type of this poiner is X*. Also, if a member function of class X is declared as const, then the type 
of this pointer is const X*
