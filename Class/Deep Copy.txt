In Deep copy, an objet is created by copying data of all variables, and it also allocates similar memory resources with
the same value to the object. In order to preform Deep copy, we need to explicitly define the copy constructor and assign
dynamic memory as well, if required. Also, it is required to dynamically allocate memory to variables in other constructors,
as well.
