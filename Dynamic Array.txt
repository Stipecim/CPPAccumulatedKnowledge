Because the array above are made up of static (non-dynamic) memory, their size must be determined before execution.
Therefore, the size needs to be a constant value. In order to create an array with a size that is not known until run-time
you need to use dynamic memory, which is allocated with the new keyword and must be assigned to a pointer or reference.

Any array in c++ is actually a pointer to the first element in the array. 

Keep in mind that just as with another pointer it is possible to exceed the vaild range of an array. It is therefore important
to keep track of the arrays length. To determine the length of a statically allocated array you can use the sizeof operator.
				       
		   in bytes  divide  4bytes - Which is an integer
int length = sizeof(myArray) / sizeof(int); //

This method cannot be used for dynamically allocated arrays.The only way to deterement the size of such an array is trough
the variable in its allocation.
