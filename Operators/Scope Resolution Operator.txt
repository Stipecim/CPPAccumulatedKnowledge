::The scope resolution operator is used to reference the global varibale or member function that is out of scope.
Therefore, we use the scope resolution operator to acces the hidden varible or function of a program.

Example, when the global and local variable or function has the same name in a program, and when we call the vraiable, by 
default it only accesses the inner or local variable without calling the global variable.

2. It defines the member function outside of the class using the scope resolution.

3. It is used to access the static variable and static function of a class.
