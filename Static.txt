Static outside of class means that linkage is gonna be internal it is gonna be visible in that one translation unit.
Static in class means that variable is going to share memory with all instances of the class, out of all instances 
there is going to be only one instance of that variable.
When static value is declared inside function, the value of the variable is preserved.
