References allow a programmer to create a new name for a variable. They provide, safer and les powerful alternative to pointers.
A reference is declared in the same way as regular variable, except that ac ampersand is appended between the data type and 
the variable name. Furthermore, at the same time as the reference is declared it must be initialized with a variable of the 
specified type. Once the reference has been assigned, or seated, it can never be reseated to another variable.
The reference has in effect to become an alias for the variable and can be usesd as though it was the original variable.
